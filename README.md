## Country Network Topologies
The country topologies are stored in thr graph-tool binary format. The repository has a Python program for loading the graphs and converting them to networkx for easy access.
In order to load the graphs, you would need to install graph-tool (https://graph-tool.skewed.de/static/doc/quickstart.html).
